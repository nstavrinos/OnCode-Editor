# OnCode-Editor

The purpose of this thesis is the development of an
Online code editor using the MERN Stack technology (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
The main features of the application are the creation of unlimited projects with a file/directory
hierarchy and sharing them among users, who will be able to edit them simultaneously. Also,
the application syncs with the userâ€™s Github account to run Git commands, supports multiple
programming languages, and offers storage for the projects on its server.
